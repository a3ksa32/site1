                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
Elara Morgan sees things others can't. Words have color. Silence has a taste. It's a neurological quirk called synesthesia a blessing for a scholarship student studying library science, and a curse for anyone trying to keep a secret.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Her ticket out of poverty is a prestigious work-study position: the night guard at Blackwood University’s ancient Athenaeum library. The rules are simple: patrol the silent, towering stacks. Report anything unusual. And never, ever go to the fifth floor after dark.
                    </p>
                    <p>But on her first night, Elara notices something wrong.</p>
                    <p>A single book is missing from its assigned place on a shelf. Just an empty space gap. To anyone else, it's a filing error. To Elara, it's a scream in the quiet. That gap leads to another: a missing student’s ID card tucked inside a century old poetry volume. Then another: a ghostly encounter with a disgraced professor who warns her that some books are not just history they are indictments.</p>
                    <p>As Elara digs deeper, she uncovers a secret society woven into the university's very foundations: The Silent Chapter. Their purpose isn't to preserve knowledge, but to curate it. To decide which truths are safe for the world to remember, and which must be erased, hidden, or rewritten to protect the institution's power.</p>
                    <p>But their curation has a dark side. People who ask too many questions disappear. Research that threatens the official narrative meets with "accidents." And gaps on library shelves are more than just missing books they are warnings, messages, and sometimes, graves.</p>
                    <p>With her unique senses allowing her to see patterns in the chaos, Elara becomes both the Silent Chapter's greatest threat and their most coveted asset. They offer her a choice: join their elegant, gilded world of controlled truth, or become another curated silence, vanished into the library's shadows.</p>
                    <p>To survive, Elara must learn to read the library's true language the language of gaps, of whispers, of absences. She must trace a conspiracy that stretches from the opium trade that built the university to the present day boardrooms where history is still being edited. And she must decide how far she'll go to expose a truth that could burn down everything including herself.</p>
                    <p>The Stacks Are Whispering is a gripping dark academic thriller that asks: In a world where history is written by the powerful, who gets to decide what is true? And what happens when the stories we’re told begin to tell on themselves?</p>
                    <p>Perfect for fans of The Secret History, The Atlas Six, and The Maidens, this atmospheric novel will pull you into a labyrinth of secrets, where every book holds a clue, every silence speaks volumes, and the only way out is to listen to what the stacks are trying to say.</p>
